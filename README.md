# Workflow-Templates

This repository contains reusable GitHub Actions workflow templates to simplify CI/CD setup across projects. These templates can be used via the `uses:` keyword in your workflows to share and centralize build logic like Docker image building and publishing.

## ðŸ“¦ Included Templates
